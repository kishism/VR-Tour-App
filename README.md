Note: 
> The development of Teachers' page was incomplete, rushed, and inadequate
> The overall (group) assignment was deducted 10% due to the inclusion of 'Login Page'.
  L A simple application like the Tour App does not require security measures or user account functionality. 
> Several page files and assets were missing during the submission
  L Team members need to be invited to contribute to the repository
